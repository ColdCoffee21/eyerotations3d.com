	<h1>Eye movements</h1>
	
		<p>Any rigid body is able to move freely in three dimensional space using six degrees of freedom. 
			Translational motion along the three orthogonal axis, correspond to three degrees of motion and the remaining three accounts for 
			the rotation of the rigid body around the three axes. The eye is such a rigid body.
			To simplify the study of eye movements, most eye tracking experiments require the head to be immobilised 
			in a chin rest such that eye tracking is restricted to only the rotational components of the total eye movement.
		</p>

		<h2>Decomposing Three-Dimensional Rotations</h2>

			<p>One of the oldest and most common ways of studying a three dimensional rotation is by decomposing it into three consecutive rotations about three orthogonal axes. </p>

			<p>Rotations around the light of sight (x-axis) is called roll that accounts for the torsional rotations of the eye and the rotation around the horizontally 
				directed y-axis is the pitch that appears as the upward or downward gaze. Finally, the rotation around the vertically directed z-axis is the yaw 
				leading to the sideways gaze.
			</p>

			<p>Such an elemental rotation can be mathematically represented using three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle
			---- about the z, y and x-axis, respectively in three dimensions, following the right-hand rule—which codifies their alternating signs.</p>

			<p>
			The Rotation matrices corresponding to each of these are as follows - </p>

			<p> Any General rotation can then be defined by the matrix multiplication of the above rotation matrices. <p>

			<p> We can describe the rotation of the eye-fixed coordinate system from the reference position to any new position 
				using the general rotation matrix represented in equation (4). This is an intrinsic rotation about z-y-x  axes. The order for matrix multiplication is from right to 
				left and desired vector for the final eye position is dependent on the order since matrix multiplication is non-commutative. 
				This can produced undesired effects.</p>

			<p> The rotation matrix R still completely describes the current eye position. However, its elements are no longer determined by the relatively simple 
				formulaes in equation 1.</p>

			<p>To understand this better, we look at figure 4 Inverting the sequence of two rotations about space-fixed axes changes the final orientation of the 
				object, even if it is rotated by the same degree [2]. The final orientation of the figure in [A] differs from that of [B] due to the non 
				commutativity of the Rotation Matrix.</p>

			<p> However, it is also possible to reach the same final orientation by two different sequence of rotations, as is the case for [A] and [C].</p>

	<h1>Donder’s Law</h1>
		
		<p><i>The proposition that for any head position and any direction of gaze the eye always assumes the same unique position, resulting in the fixation point
			being focused on the fovea. The orientation is always the same no matter where the eye came from.</i></p>
		
		<p>In order to implement Donder’s law, it is important to find a unique method to reach every final orientation or the final eye position. If the previously
			mentioned rotation matrix method is followed, there are six pos- sible sequence of rotations arising from the three rotation axes, 
			some of which reach the same orientation as the other sequence.</p>
		

	<h1>The Gimbal Arrangement</h1>	
		
		<p>One of the easiest and most commonly followed solution to Donder’s law is to nest co-ordinate systems and describe rotations in either a head-fixed or eye-fixed 
			co-ordinate system. Such a co-ordinate system is known as Gimballed Co-ordinate system. There are infinite number of possible co-ordinate systems that fulfil 
			this condition. However, for ease, we choose a vertical and a horizontal nested system.</p>
		
		<h2>Fick’s System</h2>
			<p>A Gimbal co-ordinate Fick’s system can be be used for eye tracking experiments where the head is immo- bilised using a chin rest. The sequence of rotation is horizontal, 
				vertical, and torsional or in terms of our previous notations; yaw, pitch and roll.</p>
		
		<h2>Helmholtz System</h2>
			<p>Another commonly used system in the past is the Helmholtz system that differs from the Fick’s system as it prefers the vertical axis over the horizontal axis.
				The sequence of rotation is pitch, yaw and roll about the new line of sight.</p>
	
	
	<h1>Euler Fixed Axis Theorem</h1>
		<p><i>Euler’s rotation theorem states that in a three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point.</i></p>
	
		<p>We can describe a three dimensional rotation using a vector that points in the direction of rotation. Similar to the rotation matrices, the direction of the rotation should follow the right hand thumb. A rotation rep- resented by an Euler axis
			and angle. rule as convention. Only three elements of rotations are necessary to quantify a three dimensional rotation unlike the nine elements for matrix rotations.</p>
		
		<p>A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.Every final eye position then can be described by a unique rotation vector that denotes a 
			rotation from an initial primary eye position. The rotation vectors will also have horizontal, vertical and torsional components. 
			Two most effective mathematical treatment of rotations are the quaternions and rotation vectors.</p>
