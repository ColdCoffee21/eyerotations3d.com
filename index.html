	<h1>Eye movements</h1>
	
		<p>Any rigid body is able to move freely in three dimensional space using six degrees of freedom. 
			Translational motion along the three orthogonal axis, correspond to three degrees of motion and the remaining three accounts for 
			the rotation of the rigid body around the three axes. The eye is such a rigid body.
			To simplify the study of eye movements, most eye tracking experiments require the head to be immobilised 
			in a chin rest such that eye tracking is restricted to only the rotational components of the total eye movement.
		</p>

		<h2>Decomposing Three-Dimensional Rotations</h2>

			<p>One of the oldest and most common ways of studying a three dimensional rotation is by decomposing it into three consecutive rotations about three orthogonal axes. </p>

			<p>Rotations around the light of sight (x-axis) is called roll that accounts for the torsional rotations of the eye and the rotation around the horizontally 
				directed y-axis is the pitch that appears as the upward or downward gaze. Finally, the rotation around the vertically directed z-axis is the yaw 
				leading to the sideways gaze.

			<p>Such an elemental rotation can be mathematically represented using three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle
			\( \theta \), \( \phi \) and \( \psi \) about the z, y and x-axis, respectively in three dimensions, following the right-hand rule—which codifies their alternating signs.</p>

			<p>
			The Rotation matrices corresponding to each of these are as follows - 
			\[ R_3(\theta) = \left[ \begin{matrix} \cos (\theta) & - \sin (\theta) & 0 \\ \sin (\theta) & \cos (\theta) & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right] \]
			\[ R_2(\phi)   = \left[ \begin{matrix} \cos (\phi) & 0 &  \sin (\phi) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ - \sin (\phi) & 0 & \cos (\phi) \end{matrix} \right]\]
			\[ R_1(\psi)   = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos (\psi) & - \sin (\phi) \\ 0 & \sin (\psi) & \cos (\psi) \end{matrix} \right] \]	
			</p>

			<p> Any General rotation can then be defined by the matrix multiplication of the above rotation matrices. 
			    \[  R = R_3(\theta) R_2(\phi)R_1(\psi) \]	
			    \[  R = \left[ \begin{matrix}  
				\cos(\theta)\cos(\phi) & 
				\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi)\sin(\psi) - \sin(\theta)\cos(\psi) & 
				\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi)\cos(\psi) + \sin(
				\theta)\sin(\psi) \\ 
				\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi) & 
				\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi)\sin(\psi) + \cos(\theta)\cos(\psi) & 
				\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi)\cos(\psi) - \cos(
				\theta)\sin(\psi) \\ 
				- sin(\phi) & \cos(\psi)\sin(\psi) & \cos(\phi)\cos(\psi) \end{matrix}\right] \] 		
			</p>

			<p> We can describe the rotation of the eye-fixed coordinate system from the reference position to any new position 
				using the general rotation matrix represented in equation (4). This is an intrinsic rotation about z-y-x  axes. The order for matrix multiplication is from right to 
				left and desired vector for the final eye position is dependent on the order since matrix multiplication is non-commutative. 
				This can produced undesired effects.</p>

			<p> The rotation matrix R still completely describes the current eye position. However, its elements are no longer determined by the relatively simple 
				formulaes in equation 1.</p>

			<p>To understand this better, we look at figure 4 Inverting the sequence of two rotations about space-fixed axes changes the final orientation of the 
				object, even if it is rotated by the same degree [2]. The final orientation of the figure in [A] differs from that of [B] due to the non 
				commutativity of the Rotation Matrix.</p>

			<p> However, it is also possible to reach the same final orientation by two different sequence of rotations, as is the case for [A] and [C].</p>

	<h1>Donder’s Law</h1>
		
		<p><i>The proposition that for any head position and any direction of gaze the eye always assumes the same unique position, resulting in the fixation point
			being focused on the fovea. The orientation is always the same no matter where the eye came from.</i></p>
		<figure>
			<img src="donder.png" alt="Donder’s Law [4]" style="width:100%">
			<figcaption><center><b>Donder’s Law [4]</b></center></figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>In order to implement Donder’s law, it is important to find a unique method to reach every final orientation or the final eye position. If the previously
			mentioned rotation matrix method is followed, there are six pos- sible sequence of rotations arising from the three rotation axes, 
			some of which reach the same orientation as the other sequence.</p>
		

	<h1>The Gimbal Arrangement</h1>	
		
		<p>One of the easiest and most commonly followed solution to Donder’s law is to nest co-ordinate systems and describe rotations in either a head-fixed or eye-fixed 
			co-ordinate system. Such a co-ordinate system is known as Gimballed Co-ordinate system. There are infinite number of possible co-ordinate systems that fulfil 
			this condition. However, for ease, we choose a vertical and a horizontal nested system.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="gimbal.png" alt="Demonstration of the Gimbal Co-ordinate system [3]" style="width:100%">
			<figcaption><center><b>Demonstration of the Gimbal Co-ordinate system [3]</center></b></figcaption>
		</figure>	
	
		<p>Nested Gimbal systems such as the ones mentioned below, fix a nesting order for the decomposition of a three-dimensional rotation into three consecutive rotations. 
		There is in fact a third and an even simpler way of describing a three dimensional rotation that does not depend of the order of rotations. 
		This is rotation along an orthogonal axis of the eye.</p>

		
		<h2>Fick’s System</h2>
			<p>A Gimbal co-ordinate Fick’s system can be be used for eye tracking experiments where the head is immo- bilised using a chin rest. The sequence of rotation is horizontal, 
				vertical, and torsional or in terms of our previous notations; yaw, pitch and roll.</p>
		
		<h2>Helmholtz System</h2>
			<p>Another commonly used system in the past is the Helmholtz system that differs from the Fick’s system as it prefers the vertical axis over the horizontal axis.
				The sequence of rotation is pitch, yaw and roll about the new line of sight.</p>
	
	
	<h1>Euler Fixed Axis Theorem</h1>
		<p><i><b>Euler’s rotation theorem states that in a three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point.</i></b></p>
	
		<p>We can describe a three dimensional rotation using a vector that points in the direction of rotation. Similar to the rotation matrices, the direction of the rotation should follow the right hand thumb. A rotation rep- resented by an Euler axis
			and angle. rule as convention. Only three elements of rotations are necessary to quantify a three dimensional rotation unlike the nine elements for matrix rotations.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="euler.png" alt=" Demonstration of the Euler Fixed Axis Theorem [6]" style="width:80%">
			<figcaption><center><b>Demonstration of the Euler Fixed Axis Theorem [6]</b></center></figcaption>			
		</figure>	
	
		<p>A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.Every final eye position then can be described by a unique rotation vector that denotes a 
			rotation from an initial primary eye position. The rotation vectors will also have horizontal, vertical and torsional components. 
			Two most effective mathematical treatment of rotations are the quaternions and rotation vectors.</p>
	
	<h2>Quaternions</h2>
		<p>To visualise vectors in more than three dimensions, we make use of quaternion, q which uniquely charac- terises a rotation by an angle --- about an axis nˆ.
			Such a number system extends the complex numbers and is given by equation 5.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="quat.png" alt=" Quaternion [5]" style="width:80%">
			<figcaption><center><b>Quaternion [5]</b></center></figcaption>
		</figure>
	
		<p>The quaternion has a scalar (q0) and a vector component(q). The length of the vector is determined by the
			angle --, which allows us to rewrite a quaternion as in equation 6.</p>
	
		<p>Further description and interactive videos for in depth understanding of quaternions can be found on the explorable video series webpage created by Ben Eater.</p>
	
	<h2>Rotation Vectors</h2>
		<p>The scalar-component of a unit quaternion (q0) does not contain any additional information, that is not already given by the vector part [2] .
			The rotation vector then is just a simplified quaternion given by the equation </p>
		
	<h1>Listing’s Law</h1>
	
	<p>A special realisation of Donder’s law is called the Listing’s Law. Listing’s law brings about a constriction in the three dimensional motion of the eyes
		and reduces it to almost a two dimensional problem. It states that any final orientation taken by the eye can be reached by rotation about an axis 
		that lies with the Listing’s plane shown in figure 9. Listing’s place is a two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the gaze direction of the primary 
		position of the eye. ( not the initial position of the eye but the primary position).</p>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="listing.png" alt="Listing’s plane [4]" style="width:100%">
		<figcaption><center><b>Listing’s plane [4]</b></center></figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>The reference position for a dataset that describes the Listings plane as its displacement plane is called the primary position. 
		This displacement plane will be exactly perpendicular to the reference gaze direction. For humans, this primary position is most commonly 
		when the eye is looking straight ahead with the visual axis parallel to the sagittal plane of the head.</p>
	
	<p>Essentially, Listings law defines zero torsion about a head-fixed axes. It is however possible to reach this final orientation 
		described by Listings using the eye-fixed axes such Helmholtz sequence and Fick’s sequence of rotations by the introduction of false torsion
		along the line of sight.</p>
	
	<p>However, the most simple way to implement the Listings law would be using a co-ordinate axis with origin at the primary position (1,0,0), 
		where the torsional component of the head is held at zero.</p>
	
	<p>One of the advantages of using quaternion or rotation vector formalism is the ease of implementing listings law with these tools. 
		The complete rotation vector in accordance to the Listings law can then be written as</p>
	
	<p> Where, --- describes the orientation on the rotation vector on the listings plane as explained in Listing’s law and the mathematics of eye. 
		This rotation vector describes the rotation of the point from a primary position to a final position with zero torsional component. 
		The validity of Listings law can also be checked by checking if all these rotation vectors lie in the same displacement plane known 
		as the Listings plane </p>
	
	<h1>Three Dimensional Rotations According to Lising's law</h1>
		<p>The GitHub repository consists of a set of source code that allows users to simulate the initial and final position of the of the eye taking
		into account Listings and Donder's law. The program also allows the users to visualise the final complete rotational vectors to check if they 
			lie within the Listings plane.</p>
