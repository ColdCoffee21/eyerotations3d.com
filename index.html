title: 3D Kinematics of eye movements

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Eye movements</h1>
	<p>Any rigid body is able to move freely in three dimensional space using six degrees of freedom. Translational motion along the three orthogonal axis, correspond to three degrees of motion and the remaining three ac- counts for the rotation of the rigid body around the three axes. The eye is such a rigid body.
To simplify the study of eye movements, most eye tracking experiments require the head to be immobilised in a chin rest such that eye tracking is restricted to only the rotational components of the total eye movement.
